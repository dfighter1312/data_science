## Data Science
- The process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. 
- It's an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more. It's what makes it possible for us to appropriate information, see patterns, find meaning from large volumes of data and use it to make decisions that drive business. 
- Data Science can use many of the AI techniques to derive insight from data. For example, it could use machine learning algorithms and even deep learning models to extract meaning and draw inferences from data.
- Data Science is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology while AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions.

## Data Scientist 
- Someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders.
- As long as one has a curious mind, fluency in analytics, and the ability to communicate thefindings, I consider the person a data scientist.

## Big Data
The term big data refers to data sets that are so massive, so quickly built, and so varied that they defy traditional analysis methods such as you might perform with a relational database.

## Data Mining 
The process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns.

## Machine Learning 
A subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed.
- They are trained with large sets of data.
- They learn from examples. 
- They do not follow rules-based algorithms.

## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making.
Deep learning algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patterns. It is what enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct.

## Artificial Neural Networks (Neural networks) 
A neural network in AI is a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time. Neural networks are often layer-deep and are the reason deep learning algorithms become more efficient as the data sets increase in volume, as opposed to other machine learning algorithms that may plateau as data increases.
